      <description>Adopting Elixir was a pleasure - it fit nicely into our microservice architecture and most of our tech stack. The only missing piece was our ELK-based logging infrastructure, where we sent logs to Logstash formatted in JSON, an easily machine-readable format. As there was no library at the time that did this, I decided to write one myself!
In this post, we will cover how to create your own Elixir logger backend, how to send JSON logs to Logstash via TCP, unit testing, and strategies for handling log spikes.</description>

      <description>I am a Gothenburg-based developer, with deep experience building and scaling distributed systems.
When not at Forza Football getting done whatever needs getting done, I hack on open source projects, explore nature and learn new things.
I write to remember and share my learnings.
Move fast, take risks, release early, keep things simple and be a cheerful spirit.</description>

      <description>Remember the last time you had a long, heated discussion and found a perfect solution? Me neither.
Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be amazing to have a better way to resolve arguments?
I recall a particularly exhausting discussion that went on for over a month. Long ago I worked on large scale distributed system. At some point we found a potential issue that could lead to lost updates in our data sets.</description>
